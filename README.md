Create a Java representation of playing card deck and describe the ‘Durak’ game:

●	There are 36 cards, 4 suits, 9 different cards for each suit

●	Four players have 6 unique cards each; each player goes only with one card at a time (players cards are shuffled in the beginning, then the first one from them is used); if a player doesn’t have a card to defend, he takes the card.

●	The winner is the player who has no cards left.

●	The cards are passed to each player in the collection (create a method to pass the cards randomly if have enough time)
